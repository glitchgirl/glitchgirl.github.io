<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>My name is Morgan Smith. I’m a very serious Web Developer.
I have been making sites since I was about 10, my neopets had the coolest landing pages of any digital animals. 
Then, during high school I kinda lost touch with coding, but fell in love with hardware. 
This is also when I learned a lot about OS, due to my skills in killing machines. 
I was probably the only 14 year old with a linux OS, and my dad was probably the only father who thought it would be a fun learning experience and a punishment (he was right). 
</p>

  Then in college, I took a programming class and  started to remember how much I enjoyed coding. 
  I started making some small side projects, but being in college and working I didn’t get too much free time. 
  But I did do plays, and hackathons. Of which, I won one.
</p>

<p> From that hackathon I won an internship at RSI. 
  During my internship, I got to work on .NET projects, PHP projects, and JS applications. While I was there I also managed a hackathon for a local charity. 
  Then I graduated, and applied for way to many and was overwhelmed by choice.
</p>
<p>I ended up taking a job with a company that I have been working for on and off since 2014: Windsor Fine Jewelers, where I am currently their devops engineer. 
I manage multiple ecommerce sites, using magento and woocommerce. I also run smaller, non ecommerce sites for information for the store.
I run these sites from server to css. Notably, during my time I have over tripled the site speed and helped ensure their security. 
I want to continue my serious web dev skills, especially in a structured environment where I can continue to use my skills.
