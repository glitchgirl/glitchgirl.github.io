              <p id="about_me" class="depth">Hey!
                <br>
                &nbsp My name is Morgan Smith and I am currently a software instructor at the clubhouse! I teach full-stack web development, including version control(Github), HTML, CSS (SASS), javascript (es6), node.js, express, and MySQL. I also teach soft skills like project management, SEO, accessibility, conflict resolution, and how to write documentation. In my free time, I enjoy reading and making art. With a background in e-commerce and DevOps, I bring many facets of development to my students so they leave my class as well rounded full-stack developers.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p class="depth">
                &nbsp My drive to teach is inspired by my desire to give back to my local community, and also to make the internet a better place through more inclusive design. I also love learning alongside my students to sharpen my skills, especially challenging myself to master skills that I think I am weaker in. I do this by taking online courses and building side projects.
                Knowing that there is always more to learn and improve upon, some of my greatest achievements come from big problems. When I worked as a DevOps engineer, our biggest ongoing concern was site speed and security. While I was there, I tripled the site speed and improved security through migration from Rackspace to AWS, updating WordPress to the latest and most secure version. I also led a migration from Magento 1 to Magento 2. I have also done other migration work like this, like taking a local charityâ€™s site and updating it to PHP 7, and hosted a hackathon to help fix other issues with the site.
              </p>
            </br>
              <p class="depth">
                  &nbsp Another work accomplishment that I am proud of is completely revamping my current works syllabus to reflect changes in the local tech industry. Adding things like Docker and microservices, while removing outdated content allows my students to have a competitive edge over other potential employees.
                While I love teaching, I also miss doing actual development work full time. I am extremely flexible in my skills and can do anything from project management to DevOps. Below is a portfolio of some of my projects.
