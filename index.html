                I’m a very serious Web Developer.
                I have been making sites since I was about 10, my neopets had the coolest landing pages of any digital animals. 
                Then, during high school I kinda lost touch with coding, but fell in love with hardware. 
                This is also when I learned a lot about OS, due to my skills in killing machines. 
                I was probably the only 14 year old with a linux OS, and my dad was probably the only father who thought it would be a fun learning experience and a punishment (he was right).
                Then in college, I took a programming class and  started to remember how much I enjoyed coding. 
                I started making some small side projects, but being in college and working I didn’t get too much free time. 
                But I did do plays, and hackathons. Of which, I won one. :)</p>

                From that hackathon I won an internship at RSI. 
                During my internship, I got to work on .NET projects, PHP projects, and JS applications. While I was there I also managed a hackathon for a local charity. 
                Then I graduated, and applied for way to many and was overwhelmed by choice.
              
              I ended up taking a job with a company that I have been working for on and off since 2014: Windsor Fine Jewelers, where I was their devops engineer. 
              I manage multiple ecommerce sites, using magento and woocommerce. I also run smaller, non ecommerce sites for information for the store.
              I ran these sites from server to css. Notably, during my time I have over tripled the site speed and helped ensure their security. 
              I want to continue my serious web dev skills, especially in a structured environment where I can continue to use my skills. 
              Now I work at the clubhouse, where I teach web development. I teach full stack, including node.js, html, css, mysql, and es6.
